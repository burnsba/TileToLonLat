This is a demo I made trying to learn WPF and MVVM.

Converts between OpenStreetMap tile format and longitude/lattitude

Made with Visual Studio 2012

* Creates multiple views/viewmodels at runtime
* Validation of multiple fields when entering text
* Communication between viewmodels using events

Based on the demo from http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd419663.aspx
